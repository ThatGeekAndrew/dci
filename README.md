# DTA Emulator - The Digital Conversion Inititave

Screen size is 800x450
That's definitely worth mentioning.

For adding a new screen:
Add a route to app.js in `app/scritps/app.js`
Create html page and place it somewhere in `app/views`

Try to keep everything logical. Refer to other pages for the template. Feel free to impliment crazier things, I'm not responsible if it breaks. I'll keep my backup open sourced.
